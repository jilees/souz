# Souz

Souz is a Kotlin Multiplatform AI assistant with a Compose Desktop host and an Android app entry point.

## Note for LLM

Keep this file updated whenever top level details changes.
If you are not sure about something, left a note for other developers to review.

### UI architecture principles

- UI layers (Screens and Composables) should not do neither business logic, nor IO operations.
- UI-logic should be coordinated from ViewModels. ViewModel may delegate business logic to UseCases.

### Development principles

- Prefer composition to inheritance.
- Do not mix coroutines with the JVM low level concurrency primitives such as: Volatile, Synchronize, ThreadLocal, etc).
- Utilize open closed principle.

## Features

- **Graph-based agent runtime** with explicit nodes, transitions, retries, and session history.
- **Standalone ClawHub/OpenClaw skills support across `:agent` and `:sharedLogic`**: bundle parsing, canonical hashing, sandbox-safe filesystem bundle loading, desktop-first single-user skill storage with backend user-scoped storage support, runtime-backed activated-skill command execution through `RunSkillCommand`, plus a Docker-bundled academic paper skill fixture seeded into runtime registry storage for sandbox testing.
- **Shared sandbox abstraction for tools and skills** in `:sharedLogic`: Android/Desktop shared contracts live under `sharedLogic/src/commonJvmMain/kotlin/ru/souz/runtime/sandbox/`, with Android SQLite-backed sandbox storage in `androidMain` and local/Docker process sandboxes in `jvmMain`.
- **Multi-model LLM integrations** for GigaChat (REST/voice), Qwen, AiTunnel, Anthropic Claude, and OpenAI APIs.
- **Provider-agnostic image tools** with shared runtime gateways and split responsibilities: `ViewImage` routes local image understanding through provider-specific vision gateways with file-size limits before any OpenAI byte loading, `GenerateImage` routes image creation through capability-based provider selection independent from the current chat model, and desktop capture stays under `DESKTOP` so screen-understanding requests chain `TakeScreenshot -> ViewImage` without activating image generation.
- **Local llama.cpp provider** with a thin native bridge, strict JSON tool contract, a RAM-gated local model catalog (Qwen plus Gemma 4 chat profiles), linked local EmbeddingGemma GGUF downloads/usage for embeddings, automatic Gemma multimodal projector downloads for local vision, background preload/warmup on local chat model selection, prompt-family-aware rendering (Qwen ChatML and Gemma 4 turns), prompt-prefix/KV reuse inside the native runtime, multimodal completion budgeting based on actual `mtmd` prompt/image token counts, settings-driven context windows for local inference within model caps, model storage under `~/.local/state/souz/models/`, and extracted native bridge libraries under `~/.local/state/souz/native/`.
- **Desktop working memory core** with SQLite-backed source events, facts, evidence, embeddings, conservative post-turn capture, explicit remember handling, slot-key replacement inside scope, cosine retrieval across active scopes, and compact memory prompt injection for future turns.
- **Desktop memory management UI** with a dedicated Memory screen for listing facts, filtering/search, manual fact create/edit, pin/unpin, retire/delete, details inspection, and evidence/raw turn review for writer-created facts.
- **Shared KMP runtime and application logic layer** in `:sharedLogic`: `commonJvmMain` carries Android/Desktop reusable settings contracts, remote provider clients, provider routing, memory models/services, sandbox contracts, skill storage, portable file/image/web/calculator tools, and `portableRuntimeToolsDiModule`; `jvmMain` keeps desktop/backend-only config storage, native local models, local/Docker process sandboxes, Office/PDF extraction, MCP stdio, speech, and desktop services.
- **Shared Android/Desktop UI logic layer** in `:sharedUI`: `commonJvmMain` carries reusable ViewModel base classes, DTO/state/effect contracts, model/key availability helpers, chat search, main/settings/setup/memory/tool/folder ViewModels, host-port contracts, attachment/path orchestration, and use cases; `jvmMain` and `androidMain` keep separate platform Compose screens and host adapters.
- **Android chat-agent entry point** using Android-specific screens from `:sharedUI` `androidMain` backed by the shared `MainViewModel` and `SettingsViewModel`, Android Keystore-backed provider key settings from `:sharedLogic`, SQLite sandbox/vector storage, shared remote LLM providers, portable runtime tools, and `GraphBasedAgent` through `AgentFacade` with no-op Android host adapters for desktop-only services.
- **Key-aware model selection in Settings**: chat, embeddings, and voice recognition model lists are filtered by configured provider keys; invalid saved selections are normalized to available providers.
- **MCP integration** over `stdio` and `http` with OAuth discovery and token refresh support.
- **Rich desktop host layer** in `:desktopApp`, wired through `:sharedUI` host ports: browser, calendar, mail, notes, desktop automation, TDLight Telegram, app launch, text/clipboard actions, audio, permissions, native keys, and desktop indexing.
- **Two-mode internet search**: quick-answer web lookup for simple factual questions and multi-step research mode with LLM-built strategy, broader source coverage, cited long-form synthesis, and automatic `.md` export for oversized reports.
- **Voice and desktop interaction** via audio recording/playback, global hotkeys, and native media key bindings.

## Backend Flow

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    bootstrap["GET /v1/bootstrap"] --> http["BackendHttpServer"]
    messages["POST /v1/chats/{chatId}/messages"] --> http
    bootstrap --> security["Trusted proxy headers\nX-User-Id + X-Souz-Proxy-Auth"]
    security --> meta["Bootstrap service\nfeatures, storage, tools, models, settings"]
    messages --> execution["AgentExecutionService\npersist execution + launch/finalize"]
    execution --> runtime["BackendConversationRuntimeFactory\nbuild request-scoped runtime"]
    runtime --> repo["AgentSessionRepository\nload/save persisted session snapshot"]
    runtime --> kernel["AgentExecutionKernelFactory\nshared :agent execution path"]
    kernel --> tools["runtimeToolsDiModule()\nFILES, IMAGE, WEB_SEARCH, CONFIG,\nDATA_ANALYTICS, CALCULATOR"]

```

- Backend host adapters intentionally replace desktop-only SPI pieces with no-op implementations while keeping the same graph execution kernel.
- `/v1/**` trusts user identity only from proxy-managed headers and never from request bodies.
- Storage mode now supports `memory`, `filesystem`, and `postgres`; `memory` keeps bounded in-process snapshots (10_000 entities per repository) to reduce accidental OOM risk and now includes a lightweight `UserRepository`, `filesystem` persists `data/users/{encodedUserId}/user.json` plus per-user settings/chat product/runtime data under `SOUZ_BACKEND_DATA_DIR` / `souz.backend.dataDir` (default `data/` relative to the backend process working directory) with a stable URL-safe encoded user path segment instead of the raw opaque `userId`, while `postgres` uses JDBC + HikariCP + Flyway migrations with explicit `SOUZ_BACKEND_DB_*` / `souz.backend.db.*` settings (`host`, `port`, `name`, `user`, `password`, `schema`, `maxPoolSize`, `connectionTimeoutMs`) and defaults of `127.0.0.1`, `5432`, `souz`, `souz`, `public`, `10`, and `30000`.

## Builds

- JVM/KMP modules compile and run tests with a Java 21 Gradle toolchain from the root build script, so local Gradle can be launched from newer JDKs without emitting newer class files.
- Desktop app: `./gradlew :desktopApp:run` or the existing Compose distribution tasks under `:desktopApp`. UI/ViewModel tests live under `:sharedUI:jvmTest`; desktop host/tool/service tests live under `:desktopApp:test`. For Docker sandbox mode, build the runtime image with `./gradlew :sharedLogic:buildRuntimeSandboxImage` and run with `SOUZ_SANDBOX_MODE=docker`.
- Android app: `./gradlew :androidApp:assembleDebug` builds the Android entry point. The Android host provides one Kodein graph with Android settings/runtime bindings, and `:sharedUI` `androidMain` renders Android-specific chat/settings screens backed by common ViewModels. Android uses Android Keystore-encrypted provider key storage via SharedPreferences, SQLite-backed vector/sandbox storage, and `GraphBasedAgent` chat execution through the Android-safe `:sharedLogic` LLM runtime.
- Backend JVM app: `./gradlew :backend:run`. It binds to `127.0.0.1:8080` by default, configurable with `SOUZ_BACKEND_HOST` and `SOUZ_BACKEND_PORT`.
