Notes:
- Observability events are written only to local rolling log files.
- `ChatUseCase` should delegate conversation/request bookkeeping here instead of owning extra observability state directly.
- The format uses SLF4J key-value pairs so the logs stay easy to parse and map into OpenTelemetry later.
- Retention is managed by `desktopApp/src/main/resources/logback.xml`.
